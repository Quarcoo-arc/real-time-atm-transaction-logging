# Bank Error Selection | Real-Time ATM Transaction Logging

A react application for `selecting errors` to simulate on ATM transactions.

<br>

## Getting Started

This project was developed using `React` and bootstrapped with `vite`.

<br>

In order to get this project running locally:

<br>

1. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the **backend url**.
   Eg.

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000"
```

<br>

2. Proceed to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) with your browser to see the result.

Be sure to cross-check the port number. It may be different, especially if you setup the [bank-transaction-logs project](../bank-transaction-logs/) first.

<br>

3. In order for the functionalities to work as expected, you would need to have the [`backend`](../bank-backend/README.md) running.
