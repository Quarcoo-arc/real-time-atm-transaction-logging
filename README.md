# Real-Time ATM Transaction Logging

A simulation of real-time transaction logging for Automated Teller Machines (ATMs).

## Getting Started

This project was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

<br>

The projects consists primarily of two interfaces;

- an interface for bank clients to [perform transactions](./bank-atm-interface/)
- an interface for bank staff to [view transaction logs](./bank-transaction-logs/)

<br>

There is also an interface for [selecting errors to simulate](./bank-error-selection/).

<br>

Visit [ATM Interface README](./bank-atm-interface/README.md), [Error Selection README](./bank-error-selection/README.md), [Transaction Logging README](./bank-transaction-logs/README.md) and [Backend README](./bank-backend/README.md) for information on how to setup each of the interfaces and the backend, respectively.
